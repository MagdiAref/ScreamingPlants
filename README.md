# ScreamingPlants
Plant Moisture Detector with Sound Feedback (Raspberry Pi)
This repository contains a Python program that uses a Raspberry Pi to detect the moisture level of a plant using a moisture sensor. If the moisture level drops below a predefined threshold, a pre-programmed sound is played through a speaker.

Introduction
Maintaining optimal moisture levels is crucial for the healthy growth of plants. This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi and a moisture sensor to monitor the moisture level of a plant. If the moisture level drops below a specified threshold, a sound is played through a speaker, indicating that the plant needs watering.

The program continuously reads the analog output from the moisture sensor and compares it with the predefined threshold. If the moisture level is below the threshold, it triggers the sound playback on the connected speaker.

# Hardware Requirements
To use this program, you will need the following hardware components:

Raspberry Pi board (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4)
Moisture sensor
Speaker or audio output device
Setup
Connect the moisture sensor to the Raspberry Pi. The sensor typically has three pins: VCC (power supply), GND (ground), and SIG (analog output). Connect VCC to a 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi, GND to a ground pin, and SIG to an available GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 17).

Connect the speaker or audio output device to the Raspberry Pi. Follow the instructions specific to your speaker or audio device to establish the connection.

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is running a compatible operating system (e.g., Raspbian, Raspberry Pi OS) and has Python installed.

Clone or download this repository to your Raspberry Pi.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

# Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Modify the moistureThreshold, soundFile, and soundDuration variables in the plant_moisture_detector.py file to suit your specific requirements. The moistureThreshold represents the moisture level threshold for triggering the sound playback. The soundFile should point to the desired audio file for playback. The soundDuration specifies the duration of the sound playback in seconds.

# Usage
In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

Run the following command to start the plant moisture detector program:

# Copy code
python plant_moisture_detector.py
The program will continuously read the moisture level and display it in the terminal. If the moisture level drops below the predefined threshold, the connected speaker will play the specified audio file, indicating the need for watering.

# Customization
You can customize the program according to your specific requirements. Here are some possible modifications:

Adjust the moistureThreshold variable in the plant_moisture_detector.py file to change the moisture level threshold for triggering the sound playback.

Replace the soundFile variable with a different audio file for playback or modify the program to generate sound programmatically.

Modify the soundDuration variable to change the duration of the sound played by the speaker.

Add additional features such as logging, notifications, or integrating with home automation systems.
